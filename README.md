### Consider the Longest Common Subsequence Problem: Find the longest subsequence that is a subsequence of two strings. Implement both the brute force and dynamic programming solutions to the problem and write up a report with your testing. 
### Things to consider whilst testing
    - What are the complexity classes of each solution? How do they theoretically compare in performance for different input sizes?
    - What are the best and worst cases? Test them for those as well as the average or randomized cases.
    - How do your implementation results compare to theory?
    - What does a sample run of your algorithm produce?
